## HOPEG: Higher Order Parsing Expression Grammar [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kmizu/hopeg.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kmizu/hopeg)

HOPEG is an extension of PEG by parametric rule (rule constructor).  In this repository, an interpreter
of HOPEG will be implemented.

### Grammar of HOPEG in Pseudo PEG

Note that spacing is eliminated.

    Grammer <- Rule* ";";
    
    Rule <- Identifier ("(" Identifier ("," Identifer)* ")")? "=" Expression ";";
    
    Expression <- Sequence ("/" Sequence)*;
    
    Sequence <- Prefix+;
    
    Prefix <-  ("&" / "!") Suffix;
    
    Suffix <- Primary "+"
            /  Primary "*"
            /  Primary "?"
            /  Primary;
    
    Primary <- "(" Expression ")"
             /  Call
